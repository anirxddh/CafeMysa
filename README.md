### Small Journal for Myself:

This project was what I call, my first proper full fledged commercial as well as frontend coding experience, hours of de-bugging, asking AIs where am I doing wrong, frustrating 2 AM issues when it was just another missing bracket XD etc. This was completely traditionally coded, I decided to end up doing it manually since it was just frontend, took me weeks to finish it but finally it's done.

This project taught me a lot about the Mobile Responsiveness & Javascript. Some places when I felt I should give up and shift to vibecoding the entire thing, I felt like it would be much faster but I won't be able to learn what am I trying to in the first place.

Well, I guess this was all for what I wanted to say after finishing this project.

A massive thank you to Cafe Mysa for entrusting me with such a big project. Thanks to my family as well since they gave me a lot of ideas on how to make it clean and simple!

If you are reading this, have a great day/night and please feel free to star it :D. Cheers!
